# NFT-Gated Staking

## Overview
NFT-Gated Staking is a smart contract-based staking system that requires users to hold a specific NFT to participate. This allows NFT projects to create exclusive staking pools, reward loyal holders, and add more utility to their NFTs.

## Features
- **NFT-Gated Access** â€“ Only NFT holders can stake tokens
- **Customizable Rewards** â€“ Different rewards based on NFT ownership and staking duration
- **Secure Smart Contracts** â€“ Built with Solidity and follows best practices
- **Flexible Staking Periods** â€“ Support for multiple lock-up durations
- **Optimized Gas Usage** â€“ Efficient transactions to minimize costs

## Use Cases
- **Exclusive Staking Pools** â€“ Reward NFT holders with exclusive staking options
- **DAO Membership Benefits** â€“ Provide staking incentives for governance participation
- **Play-to-Earn & Gaming** â€“ Require NFTs for access to special staking rewards

## Tech Stack
- **Solidity** â€“ Smart contract development
- **Hardhat** â€“ Development, testing, and deployment framework
- **OpenZeppelin** â€“ Secure contract standards
- **Ethereum & EVM-Compatible Chains** â€“ Deployable on multiple networks

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sorXCode/NFT-Gated-Staking.git
cd NFT-Gated-Staking
```

Install dependencies:
```sh
yarn install
```

## Deployment

Compile the smart contract:
```sh
yarn hardhat compile
```

Run tests:
```sh
npx hardhat test
```

Deploy to a local blockchain:
You'll need 2 terminals for this; one to run the node, and the other to run the project.
In one terminal:
```sh
npx hardhat node
```

In another:
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Deploy to a testnet:
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network ropsten
```

## Usage
1. Ensure users hold the required NFT.
2. Interact with the staking contract to deposit tokens.
3. Rewards accumulate based on the staking period and NFT tier.
4. Withdraw staked tokens and claim rewards after the lock-up period.

## Smart Contract Details
- **NFT Verification**: Uses ERC-721/ERC-1155 standards to verify ownership.
- **Reward Mechanism**: Rewards are distributed proportionally based on staking duration and NFT tier.
- **Security Measures**: Implements best practices to prevent reentrancy and exploits.
